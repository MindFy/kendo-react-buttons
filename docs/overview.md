# Buttons Overview

Buttons provide a clickable UI functionality with arbitrary content. The Kendo UI for React Buttons package includes the Kendo UI for React Button and ButtonGroup widgets.

Apart from the consistent Kendo UI styling they support, the Buttons and ButtonGroups provide a keyboard operability for elements, such as the `span` option, which natively do not have it. Buttons are initialized from any element with any content and may include both inline and block elements. Although each Button represents a separate widget instance on the page, multiple buttons can be initialized simultaneously. Buttons can be temporarily enabled and disabled according to the business logic of your project. They can also accommodate background, image, and font icons, which help you to send your message across much more easily and provide a meaningful context.
