# ButtonGroup Overview

The Kendo UI ButtonGroup for React is a container for two or more Kendo UI Button components. Each Button can be separately configured depending on your project requirements and according to the [Button client-side API]({% slug api_button_kendouiforreact %}).  

The ButtonGroup is a component that is part of the Buttons `npm` package of the Kendo UI suite for React.
