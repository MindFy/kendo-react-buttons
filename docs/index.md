# Buttons Overview

Buttons provide a clickable UI functionality with arbitrary content. The Kendo UI for React Buttons package includes the Kendo UI Button and ButtonGroup components for React.

The Button represents an individual component instance of a button on a page, while the ButtonGroup contains a number of button instances that can be initialized and controlled simultaneously.  

Apart from the consistent Kendo UI styling they support, both the Button and ButtonGroup components provide a keyboard operability for elements. Buttons can be temporarily enabled and disabled depending on the business logic of your project. They can also accommodate background, image, and font icons, which help you to send your message across much more easily and provide a meaningful context.
